NAME
----
guilt-split - Split a patch into multiple ones

SYNOPSIS
--------
include::usage-guilt-split.txt[]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
Run a user-specified tool that takes a patch, performs some logic and returns
a set of files that may (but are not required to) represent that same changes
as the original patch.

The tool may ask the user for specific instructions or use some predefined
algorithm, guilt does not care as long as it gets the filenames and names of
resulting patches. The tool emits this information by writing the following
lines to its stdout:

	/some/patch prepatch
	/some/other/patch .
	/yet/another/patch postpatch1
	/oh/forgot/another/patch postpatch2

Note the '.' patch name in the example above. This signals guilt that the
file "/some/other/patch" contains the new contents of the patch guilt-split
was originally run on. This patch will inherit the original patch's commit
message.

By default, the tool to be used for splitting the patch is determined by
inspecting the GUILT_SPLIT_TOOL environment variable. If the user wishes
to use another tool, they are free to specify it as the first argument
to the guilt-split command.
